# mbgex2

**mbgex2** is a tool that mass-exports ERC Megabank Utilities bills.

This is v2, it should work with the latest [erc.megabank.ua](erc.megabank.ua) portal redesign.

## Prerequisites

- .NET 5 SDK
- Visual Studio / Visual Studio Code

## Usage

```
mbgex2.exe <username> <password> <date-from> <date-to>

Example:
mbgex2.exe user@mail.com pwd1 2019-01-01 2020-01-01
```

NOTES:
- export is performed into `bin` folder
- the tool check first three accounts (usually users have a single one) - it's not clear how to get the accounts list
- dates are inclusive
- dates format preferably is `yyyy-MM-dd`, but parsing depends on your local settings
- dates should be in the following order: `start-date`, then `end-date`

## Output

1. Raw data. JSON files of what APIs give back.
2. CSVs. Data grouped by account ID and utility type.
